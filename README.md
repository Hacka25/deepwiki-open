A collection of source files!

These files appear to be related to a Next.js project, specifically designed for deployment on a Docker container. Here's a brief summary of each file:

1. **Relevant source files** (no code): This is not a code file, but rather a list of other relevant source files used as context.
2. **next.config.ts**: This file contains the configuration settings for the Next.js project. It defines various options, such as the output format, rewrites, and environment variables. Specifically, it sets up rewrites for API endpoints, local repository, and wiki cache.
3. **Dockerfile**: This is a Docker build script that creates an image for your Next.js application. The file consists of multiple stages:
	* `node_base`: Installs Node.js (version 20) on top of the Alpine Linux base image.
	* `node_deps`: Copies the project's `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files, installs dependencies using `npm ci`, and sets the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `production`.
	* `node_builder`: Copies the `node_modules` directory from the previous stage, builds the application using `npm run build`, and copies the output files (public folder) into the image.
	* `py_deps`: Installs Python 3.11 on top of the Alpine Linux base image, sets up a virtual environment (`venv`), and installs dependencies for the API using `pip`.
	* The final stage uses Python 3.11 as the base image, sets up the working directory, and copies the API files into the image.
4. **Other files**: There are no other files mentioned in this context, but it's possible that there may be additional files (e.g., environment variables, database configuration) not included here.

In summary, these files seem to be related to a Next.js project designed for deployment on a Docker container, with specific configurations for API endpoints and local repository, as well as Python dependencies for the API.
