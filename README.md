The files you've provided are:

**Relevant source files**

* `next.config.ts`: A Next.js configuration file that defines the behavior of a web application.
* `package.json` (not shown): The package configuration file for your project, which lists dependencies and scripts.
* `Dockerfile`: A Dockerfile that builds an image for your project.

Let me break down what I see in these files:

**Next.config.ts**

This file defines the configuration for a Next.js application. It sets up two rewrites rules to redirect requests from the `/api/wiki_cache` and `/export/wiki` paths to an external API server (`TARGET_SERVER_BASE_URL`). The `output` option is set to `'standalone'`, which means that Next will generate a standalone HTML file for each page, rather than generating code that needs to be executed by a runtime environment.

**Dockerfile**

This Dockerfile uses the official Node.js 20 image as its base and adds a new layer on top of it. It doesn't specify any commands or instructions beyond this initial step, so I'm guessing that there are more instructions in the file that aren't shown here.

Some observations:

* The `next.config.ts` file is using environment variables (e.g., `SERVER_BASE_URL`) to configure its behavior.
* The Dockerfile appears to be building an image for a Node.js application, but it's not clear what dependencies or commands are being used beyond the initial setup step.

If you have any specific questions about these files or would like me to clarify something, feel free to ask!
