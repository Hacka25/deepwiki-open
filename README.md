This is a collection of source files related to a web application built with Next.js and deployed using Docker. Here's a brief summary of each file:

**Relevant source files**

The `Relevant source files` section lists the following files:

1. `@emnapi/core`: A package for building WASI (WebAssembly System Interface) threads.
2. `@emnapi/runtime`: A runtime environment for executing WebAssembly code.
3. `@eslint-community/eslint-utils`: Utilities for working with ESLint, a JavaScript linter.
4. `@eslint-community/regexpp`: A regular expression parser for use in ESLint.
5. `config-array`: A package for configuring arrays of objects.

**next.config.ts**

This file defines the Next.js configuration. It sets up outputting static files, and defines rewrites for specific routes:

1. `/api/wiki_cache/:path*`: Rewrites requests to this route to `${TARGET_SERVER_BASE_URL}/api/wiki_cache/:path*`.
2. `/export/wiki/:path*`: Rewrites requests to this route to `${TARGET_SERVER_BASE_URL}/export/wiki/:path*`.
3. `/api/wiki_cache`: Rewrites requests to this route to `${TARGET_SERVER_BASE_URL}/api/wiki_cache`.
4. `/local_repo/structure`: Rewrites requests to this route to `${TARGET_SERVER_BASE_URL}/local_repo/structure`.

**Dockerfile**

This file defines a Docker image for building and deploying the web application.

1. It starts by creating an Alpine Linux-based Node.js environment (`node:20-alpine`).
2. It then copies the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files into the `/app` directory.
3. It runs `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps` to install dependencies.
4. The Docker image is split into three stages:
	* `node_deps`: Installs dependencies using `npm ci`.
	* `node_builder`: Builds the application using `npm run build`.
	* `node_base`: Runs the built application.

Note that this file uses a syntax specific to Docker, which is defined in the first line (`# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1-labs`).
