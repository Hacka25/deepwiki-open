This is a collection of source files related to a project. Here's a brief summary of each file:

**Relevant source files**

These are the source files used as context for this discussion.

### File: next.config.ts

* This file defines the configuration for a Next.js application.
* It sets up the output to be standalone, and specifies some rewrite rules for URLs.
* The `TARGET_SERVER_BASE_URL` environment variable is set to either `http://localhost:8001` or whatever value is set in the environment.

### File: Dockerfile

* This is a Dockerfile that builds an image for this project.
* It has several stages:
	+ The first stage (`node_base`) installs Node.js and npm.
	+ The second stage (`node_deps`) installs dependencies (package.json) using npm.
	+ The third stage (`node_builder`) copies the Node app code, runs `npm run build`, and copies the built assets.
	+ The fourth stage (`py_deps`) installs Python dependencies using pip.
	+ The final stage sets up a Python environment and copies the API code.

The file also exposes ports 8001 (default) and 3000, and defines a script to run both the backend and frontend.
