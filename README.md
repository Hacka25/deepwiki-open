A treasure trove of files!

Let me summarize the contents for you:

**Relevant source files**

These are the files that were used as context, which is helpful in understanding the project.

1. **@emnapi/core**: A library for building WASI (WebAssembly System Interface) applications.
2. **@emnapi/runtime**: Another library from @emnapi, providing runtime support for WASI apps.
3. **@eslint-community/eslint-utils**: A utility library for ESLint (a linter for JavaScript).
4. **@eslint/config-array**: A configuration library for ESLint, specifically for arrays.

**next.config.ts**

This file is the configuration for a Next.js project. It exports a `NextConfig` object that defines various settings for the project. In this case:

1. The `output` option is set to `'standalone'`, which means that Next will generate a standalone HTML file instead of generating a server-side rendered page.
2. The `rewrites` function is defined, which specifies URL rewrites for the project. There are four rewrites:
	* `/api/wiki_cache/:path*` -> `${TARGET_SERVER_BASE_URL}/api/wiki_cache/:path*`
	* `/export/wiki/:path*` -> `${TARGET_SERVER_BASE_URL}/export/wiki/:path*`
	* `/api/wiki_cache` -> `${TARGET_SERVER_BASE_URL}/api/wiki_cache`
	* `/local_repo/structure` -> `${TARGET_SERVER_BASE_URL}/local_repo/structure`

**Dockerfile**

This is a Dockerfile for building a Node.js application. It uses the `node:20-alpine` image as its base and defines two stages:

1. **node_deps**: This stage installs dependencies using `npm install`.
2. **node_base**: This stage sets up the environment and installs any additional dependencies required by the project.

Please note that this summary is based on a quick analysis, and you may need to review these files in more detail to understand the project fully.
