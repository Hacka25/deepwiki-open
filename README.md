This appears to be a collection of code files related to a web application. Here's a breakdown of each file:

**Relevant source files**

* `package.json`: This is the main configuration file for the project, listing dependencies and scripts.
* `next.config.ts`: This file configures the Next.js framework, setting up routing rules and output options.
* `Dockerfile`: This is a Docker build script that sets up a Node.js environment, installs Python and its dependencies, and copies files from the previous stages.

Some observations:

* The project seems to be using Next.js for client-side rendering and server-side rendering.
* There's a focus on caching and exporting data (e.g., `/api/wiki_cache` and `/export/wiki/`).
* The Dockerfile is quite complex, setting up multiple environments and copying files around. This suggests that the application has both Node.js and Python components.
* The project appears to be running on port 8001 by default.

If you have any specific questions about this code or would like me to help with a particular issue, feel free to ask!
